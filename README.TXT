sm-photo-tool

Small script to manage photos and galleries on smugmug.com

Welcome to the new home of sm-photo-tool. This a small python script
used to manage photos and galleries on smugmug.com. Using sm-photo-tool
requires an account on smugmug.com.

sm-photo-tool is based on the original sm_tool.py (smugmug.py) by
John Ruttenberg.

I wanted to find a home for sm_tool.py and give it issue and version
tracking.

sm_tool.py - actual python script
smugmugrc - configuration file used by the script
LICENSE.TXT - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 2.0
sm_tool.spec - Fedora Core RPM spec file.  Not yet finished.
