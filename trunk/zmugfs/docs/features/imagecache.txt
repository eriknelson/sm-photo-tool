IMAGE CACHE
------------
There is a performance problem when reading images from zmugfs.

open() is implemented as follows:
  * login to smugmug
  * get urls of imageid
  * open httpconnection to img url
  * read data
  * store data in dict with path to filename as key

read()
  * find imgdata in dict
  * return section of imgdata based on offset and size params

release()
  * remove imgdata from dict

The release method is what causes the performance issue because next
go round we have to fetch the image data again. One option is to 
leave them in the dict the entire time, but we'll run out of memory
fast with imgdata around the 2MB range * 100 images and you're already
at 200MB.

One option is to limit the number of images we keep in memory. I think
a sensible default would be 5 - 10 which is about 10 - 20 MB.

Then on disk we could store more say 100MB or 50 images. The location
of the cache would be $HOME/.zmugfs/cache.

Now for configuration items. The configuration file will have two (2)
new keys:

image.disk.cache= in megabytes
image.memory.cache=? (right now it'll be number of images)
